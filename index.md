## TheDegen.farm

TheDegen.farm is a farming project launched on Avalanche from the Run It Back community. The vision of this project was to bring a high APR farming experience to compliment the current meme culture movement.

## How Farming Works

Traditional farming came into being as a way to incentivize liquidity to the original Uniswap. The farming utilized on TheDegen.farm is classic LP farming which works with Uniswap V2 style pair tokens (Traderjoe V1). Users can create LP (pair tokens) and deposit them into the farm to earn a portion of the farms emission. TheDegen.farm also supports single sided asset staking which works the same way but there is no need to create the pair tokens, simply deposit the required assets and receive rewards.

## Deposit & Withdrawal Fees

We have set zero fees by default for the farm tokens primary pools: GAINS/AVAX, & GAINS. Other farms may or may not have a fee depending on which farm pool it is. The deposit and withdrawal fees are listed in each farms details section below the Deposit & Withdraw buttons. Users that hold a RIB404 NFT will have no fees even if the farm has a fee, if you'd like to be able to deposit and withdraw without fees on all pools you can get yourself a RIB404 NFT!

## Farm Emissions & Launch

TheDegen.farm's token GAINS emissions are currently set to 0.36 GAINS per second, which works out to 933k tokens per month or 11.1m tokens per year. At launch 100k GAINS were minted and paired with 10 AVAX with a primary AVAX/GAINS farm, and a RunItBack single sided staking pool as a way to distribute the initial gains tokens to RunItBack holders.
